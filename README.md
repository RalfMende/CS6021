# CS6021
iPad Remote Controller for Märklin Central Station in ControlUnit-Design

The Idea behind the app:
- Look and feel of the old Märklin digital components on your iPad
- Implemented devices: CONTROL_UNIT, KEYBOARD and MEMORY
- Functionality behind buttons are translated in background to CS commands (sent via network requests)
- Multiple instances of each device possible for faster access (i.e. one CONTROL_UNIT commands one locomotive)
- MM and DCC support (MFX only via access to lists in CS)
- Support for all Central Stations: CS3, CS2, "fakeCS2" and later for CS1/ESU (for they use a different protocol)
- App to run only on tablets, as screen on phones would be not sufficient at time of development start
- Remove the limitations of original devices:
  - > 80 addresses
  - > 4 functions
  - not only MM protocol
  - remind speed/function-status of locomotives
  - enable multi tractions of locomotives
  - maybe even programming of CVs
